Demo of Cart-Pole MDP

Demo of Cart-Pole (pole balancing) reinforcement learning problem.

Solved in Model-Based Reinfocement Learning setting using: 
Vector-valued Matching Pursuit to learn features 
Vector-valued Linear Regression to learn dynamics

Demos:
CP_1ter.mov		% 1 iteration of policy improvement (no learning)
CP_30iter.mov		% 30 iterations of policy improvement (almost)
CP_40iter.mov		% 40 iterations of policy improvement (perfect learning)
